##Variables Description
This data was gathered from research that was performed at UCI. Most of the variable descriptions come from this site (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
and the READ.ME and features_info.txt file in the following link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 

This Code Book will give descriptions about the transformations on the original data as the links above do a great job explaining the details of how the data was collected. 

After the data was collected

##Data Description

##Transformation/Work to Clean Data from Raw Form
This data set is a pared down version of the original found in the zip file included in the first section. 

The original data set (can be found in the zip file) contained 10 separate files. Four of these files were used for explanation. These were 
*features_info.txt - 
*features.txt 
*activity_labels.txt - 
*README.txt - 

Six of these files were the raw data files: 2 X files, 2 Y files, and 2 subject files. 
*X_test.txt - 
*y_test.txt 
*subject_test.txt -
*X_train.txt - 
*y_train.txt 
*subject_train.txt -


It only gathers the mean and standard deviation values in the data set.
